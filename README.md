Here's our [Presentation](https://thealexhong.github.io/companion)!

###Your own personal robot is here to serve and protect you!

An assistive robot developed using Android hardware and SDK. The app connects to a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Brick as the mobile base of the robot via Bluetooth, and another smart phone as the face of the robot via Wifi Direct. The robot has her own personality and can interact socially with facial affects to the user.

The user is required to have a LEGO EV3 Mindstorm set, and 2 smart phones running Android 4.2 or higher.

The project was inspired by my first start-up: [Robot Playtime](http://robotplaytime.com).
